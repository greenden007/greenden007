### Hey there, I'm Rohan Cherukuri! :grin: ###

I'm a junior going to Oswego East High School, looking to major in Computer Science and then work either backend or full-stack in the cybersecurity sector<br/>
I've been coding since I was 7, with primary experience in Rust, Python, Java, and C <br/><br/>

Aside from writing code, I'm an avid chess player, and a huge fan of Space Exploration
